# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Our interactive website allows users to navigate between the Home, Calendar, Product Comparison, Accessibility, and About Us pages. 

One prevalent issue in the skincare space is the lack of guidance on combining different products safely, leading to potential skin irritation or worsening of concerns. Additionally, it may be overwhelming for users to build a weekly skincare routine, especially with so many different products on the market. 

Glass Skin aims to address these issues by empowering users with accurate skincare information. Whether you're a skincare enthusiast or a beginner, our website will take your skincare concerns and build a personalized skincare routine for you.

Additionally, through our Compatibility Checker, users can check whether their skincare products can be used at the same time. 

Our goal is to serve as an educational resource to empower users to make informed skincare decisions, promote inclusivity and well-being in the skincare space.
